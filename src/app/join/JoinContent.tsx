                        Everyone is already part of the Creative Labs community! We also have various roles that students can apply to every quarter. Creative Labs has three main roles: Project Leads, Project Members, and Internal Board Members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our first main component is the internal board. The internal board is responsible for running things behind the scenes like organizing events, socials, and workshops. Responsibilities and tasks vary depending on which team within the internal board you apply to. These teams include Design, Tech, Marketing/External, and Projects. In simpler terms, the Creative Labs community is managed by a small group of UCLA designers, developers, marketers, and project managers hoping to create cool and creative things together!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        External projects consist of Project Leads and Project Members who work together to complete a project by the end of the quarter. Project Leads apply with a creative idea, and Project Members help that vision come true with their various skills.
